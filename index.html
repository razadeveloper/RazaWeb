          	<p class="page">In my last article we’ve learned actually what is Angular JS, how to use it etc. Today we’re going to jump into deeper of Angular JS. First of all we’re going to learn the architecture of Angular then we’ll be creating something our of it. Now let’s stop time wasting & learn about this beautiful & modern <strong>Javascript framework.</strong> 

At the very beginning of this article we’re gonna first discuss about the “architecture” of Angular. First Angular supports “Two-way-binding”. This means in the form field will instantly updated through the Angular models that means in the most cases you don’t need to wait for some specific events to pull that data & then show it to the view of your client. Angular will automatically pull the data through model & update your field as easy as that. Secondly Angular has a special structure called “Dirty Checking”. That means you don’t have to put your data in a special structure & find it via getter or setter method instead you can simply put your model data into simple old javascript objects & Angular will handle that for you it’ll automatically respond whenever your data changes & the update the fields. Lastly Angular is build on “Dependency Injection”. This is for making your application secure & also better testability. We’re not gonna discuss about “Dependency Injection” in this article. If you’re more curious then you can learn about this in this article (http://en.wikipedia.org/Dependency_injection)

Angular Architecture

Now let’s talk about Angular Components. Firstly in Angular everything starts with a “Controller”. It’s the essential player in Angular framework. Controller contains both “logic & state”. Next there comes “Views”. Views are made of “bindings & directives”. This is how Angular talks to & listens to the user. Controllers can communicate with Views in two-way or one-way bindings. Lastly “Services”. This is the core component of Angular. It actually contains the real logic of your application. If you think of your application you might think where you should put the real logic of application. This is the part where you want to put the logic.</p>
